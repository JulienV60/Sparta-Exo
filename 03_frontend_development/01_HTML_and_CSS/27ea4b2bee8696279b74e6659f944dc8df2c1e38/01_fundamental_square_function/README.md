# Fundamentals: Square (function)

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

You are asked to write a function that squares any number it receives.

## SPECS

The function you need to code is in `src/squareNumber.ts`.

Write a function with the following specifications:

- It takes a `number` as a parameter.
- It returns a `number` which is the square of the parameter value.

## EXAMPLES

```js
squareNumber(5) // should return 25
```

We provide you an `index.ts` file which `console.log` a call of your function with `7` as an argument, so you can use `yarn start` to check that you have the right result:

```shell-session
$ yarn start # should print
49
```
