# Fundamentals: Capitalize (function)

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

You are asked to write a function that takes a string and makes its first character a capital letter.

## SPECS

The function you need to code is in `src/capitalize.ts`.

Write a function with the following specifications:

- It takes a `string` as a parameter.
- It returns that `string` with its first character capitalized.

## EXAMPLES

```js
capitalize("frieda") // returns "Frieda"
```

We provide you with an `index.ts` file which will `console.log` the calls made to the functions you need to write. They will be called with `james` and `james bond` as arguments.

You can use `yarn start` to check that you have the expected result:

```shell-session
$ yarn start # should print
"Bond"
"James bond"
```
