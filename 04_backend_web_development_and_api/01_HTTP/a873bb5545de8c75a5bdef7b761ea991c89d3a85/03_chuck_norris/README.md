# Chuck Norris Web Service

## Context and Objectives

We all know Chuck Norris Jokes. They're **always** funny (except when they're not). Even if we have to write code to get them!
In this exercice, you'll have to call the Chuck Norris Web Service.
In order to do this, read the **[documentation](https://api.chucknorris.io/)** first.

## Specs

Implement the two following functions:

- `getCategories()` in `src/getCategories.js` to get Chuck Norris jokes Web Service categories and use `console.log` to print the result so the user can choose one of them.
- `getChuckNorrisJoke()` in `src/getChuckNorrisJoke.js` to get ONE joke in a specific category and log it with `console.log` in the terminal.

> **Note**: You have the package `@fewlines-education/request` already imported in your files. Give the [request documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fewlines-education/request) a read to see how to do a GET request.

You can use `yarn test` to help you during the development. When you're happy with your work, try it with `yarn start` (warning, `yarn start` will not work until you finish the two functions).
