# Warmup: Lottery draw (function)

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

You are asked to create a function `lottery_draw` which creates a lottery draw of 6 numbers between 0 and 100 (included)

## SPECS

The function you need to code is in `src/lottery_draw.ts`.

Write a function with the following specifications:

- It takes no parameter.
- It returns a type `Draw`, which is an array of 6 numbers
  - Every number of the array should have a value between 0 and 100 (included)

## EXAMPLES

```js
lottery_draw() // for example, returns [24, 2, 66, 12, 5, 90]
```

You can use `yarn start` to check that you have the right result:

```shell-session
$ yarn start # should print
[24, 2, 66, 12, 5, 90] # for example
```
