# Head or Tail

## Context and objectives

Let's play a Head or Tail contest

## Specs

In `src/head-or-tail.ts`, code a function that takes `"head"` or `"tail"` as input and returns a Promise of a string.

This function should:

- use the `getRandomFace()` function,
- resolve to `"Well done."` if the user guesses correctly,
- reject to `"Nope."` if the user guess incorrectly.
