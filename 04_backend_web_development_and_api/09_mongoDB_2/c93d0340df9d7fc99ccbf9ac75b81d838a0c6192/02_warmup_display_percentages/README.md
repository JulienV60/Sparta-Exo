# Warmup: Display percentages

## Context and objectives

It's been a long time we used the `map` function on an array.

Let's do some array transformation.

## Specs

In `src/percentage.ts`, complete the function `humanPercentage`.

It takes an array of numbers between 0 and 1 and it returns an array of string like this:

```typescript
humanPercentage([0.1, 0.32, 0.721, 0.458]);
// -> ["10%", "32%", "72%", "46%"]
```

Note that percentages should be rounded.
