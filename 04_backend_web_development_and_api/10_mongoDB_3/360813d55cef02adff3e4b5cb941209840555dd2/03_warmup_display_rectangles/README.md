# Warmup: Display a rectangle with lines and columns

## Context and objectives

Make a function that returns a rectangle of stars

## Specs

Copy paste your `line` function from the "Make a line" exercise in `src/line.ts` (don't forget the `export`).
Copy paste your `column` function from the "Make a column" exercise in `src/column.ts` (don't forget the `export`).

Of course, make sure that tests are passing for both previous exercises.

In the `src/rectangle.ts` file, you now have access to your two functions:

- `line` takes a number and returns a line of stars of that size
- `column` takes a number and a string and returns that many number of lines

From those, make a function that takes a `width` and an `height` that returns a rectangle of stars.

Hint: Beware of **not** naming any variable the same as the two functions
