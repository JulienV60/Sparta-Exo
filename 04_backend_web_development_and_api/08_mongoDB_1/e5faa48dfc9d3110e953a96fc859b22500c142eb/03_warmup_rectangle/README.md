# Warmup: Rectangle

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

Make a function that returns a rectangle composed of `*` from a width and height.

## SPECS

Using `for` loops, make a function that returns a string `height` lines and with `width` stars per line.

Types are already there (**use them to help you**) and you can use `yarn start` to check that you have the right result:

```shell-session
$ yarn start # should print
A rectangle of 2 by 2
**
**


Another rectangle of 4 by 6
