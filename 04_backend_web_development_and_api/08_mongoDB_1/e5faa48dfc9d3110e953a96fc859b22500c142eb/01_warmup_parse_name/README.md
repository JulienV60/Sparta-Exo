# Warmup: Parse Name

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

You were asked to transform a name from one string to a `Person` object with the `firstName` and `lastName` keys.

You should use one of the [String functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) for that.

## SPECS

The function you need to code is in `src/parse-name.ts`.

Types are already there (**use them to help you**) and you can use `yarn start` to check that you have the right result:

```shell-session
$ yarn start # should print
{ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'McLane' }
```
