# Warmup: Print Numbers

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

Print the numbers from 1 to 100 to stdout.

## SPECS

Using a `for` loop, print the numbers from 1 to 100 in the `src/print-numbers.ts` file.

Types are already there (**use them to help you**) and you can use `yarn start` to check that you have the right result:

```shell-session
$ yarn start # should print
1
2
3
...
99
100
```
