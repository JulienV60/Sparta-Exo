# Letter count

## Context and objectives

When doing loops, we sometimes need to count things. Here, we want to to count how many times a character occurs in a given string.

## Specs

In the `src/index.js`, write a function `letterCount` that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character occur in the string.

E.g.

```javascript
letterCount("gattaca", "a"); // 3
letterCount("gattaca", "g"); // 1
letterCount("azerty", "b"); // 0
```

You can see what your function does by running

```bash
yarn start
```

and run the tests with

```bash
yarn test
```
