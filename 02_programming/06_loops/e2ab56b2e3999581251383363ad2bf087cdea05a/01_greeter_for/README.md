# Always working greeter

## Context and objectives

For the first exercise of the day, you want to say hello to people but this time, there can be any number of them.

## Specs

In the `src/index.js`, write a function `greeter` that takes an array of names as an argument, and prints for each "Hello <name>!"

E.g.

```javascript

greeter(teachers)
/*
Hello Cl√©ment!
Hello Nicolas!
...
*/

```

You can see what your function does by running

```bash
yarn start
```

and run the tests with

```bash
yarn test
```
