# Draw me a square

## Context and objectives

Let's use loops to draw things on the console, this time a square.

## Specs

In the `src/index.js`, write a function `square` that takes the size of the square as a parameter and that displays a square of `*` in the console.

E.g.

```javascript
square(4);
// ****
// ****
// ****
// ****
```

You can see what your function does by running

```bash
yarn start
```

and run the tests with

```bash
yarn test
```
