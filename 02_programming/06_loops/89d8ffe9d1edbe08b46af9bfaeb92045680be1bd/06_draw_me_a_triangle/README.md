# Draw me a triangle

## Context and objectives

Let's use loops to draw things on the console, this time a right triangle.

## Specs

In the `src/index.js`, write a function `triangle` that takes the height of the triangle:

E.g.

```javascript
triangle(4);
// *
// **
// ***
// ****
```

You can see what your function does by running

```bash
yarn start
```

and run the tests with

```bash
yarn test
```
