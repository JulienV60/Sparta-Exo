# Playing with upper case

## Context and Objectives

When you want to uppercase a string or some part of it, `toUpperCase()` is the right tool for you

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `07_play_with_uppercase` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

Let's create different constants:

- a constant `bigQuestion` bound to a string: `"SPARTAN, WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION?!"` using `toUpperCase()` and the previous constant `question`

- a constant `repeatBigQuestion` bound to a string: `"I REPEAT, SPARTAN, WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION?!"` using `toUpperCase()` and the previous constant `question`
