# Playing with Arrays

## Context and Objectives

Arrays are really useful for a lot of things, as you will see throughout this course.
That's why you need to be familiar with them.

Remember to look in [the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) if you need help or more information.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `09_play_with_arrays` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

### Define arrays and access to their values

- Create an array called `digits` with numbers **from 0 to 9**;
- Create a constant called `first` for the **first slot** of your array;
- Create a constant called `last` for the **last slot** of your array;
- Create a constant called `sixth` for the slot at **the position 6** of your array;
