# Playing with charAt

## Context and Objectives

What about choosing a character in your string? `charAt()` is here for you!

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `06_play_with_charat` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

Let's create different constants:

- a constant `letterAtThirdPosition` bound to a string that is the third position character in question using `charAt()` and the previous constant `question`

- a constant `letterAtFourthPosition` bound to a string: "The letter at the fourth position is r" using `charAt()` and the previous constant `question`
