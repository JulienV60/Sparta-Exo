# Playing with strings

## Context and Objectives

Variables and constants are the main building blocks of any application.
You will have to create, assign and reassign a whole lot of them so it's better to start quickly.

Let's start with the string type.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `01_play_with_strings` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

Let's create two different constants:

- a constant called `question`, binded to a string: "Spartan, what is your profession?!";
- a constant called `answer`, binded to a string: "Dev dev dev!";
