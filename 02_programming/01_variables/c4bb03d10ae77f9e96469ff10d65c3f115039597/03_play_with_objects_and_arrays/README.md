# Playing with objects and arrays

## Context and Objectives

Now let's use more complex variables.. Objects and arrays ðŸ˜Ž

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `03_play_with_objects_and_arrays` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

Let's create different constants:

- a constant called `sparta`, binded to an object with a field `check`, with the value of `question` and with the field `response`, with the value of `answer`;
- a constant called `leader`, binded to the value of the field `check` of the object `sparta`;
- a constant called `digits`, binded to an array of numbers from zero to nine.
