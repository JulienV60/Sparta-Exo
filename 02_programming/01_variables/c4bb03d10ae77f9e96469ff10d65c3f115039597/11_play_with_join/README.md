# Playing with join

## Context and Objectives

What about making this array fancier, by joining all items? ðŸ˜Ž

Remember to look in [the array methods documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#instance_methods) if you need help or more information.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `11_play_with_join` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

### Use some methods

- Create another array called `litteralDigits` from **zero to nine** where each array entry is a spelled-out number (E.g. "zero", "one", ...);
- Use `join()` to create, into the constant `allDigits`, a string like this : `zero - one - two ...`.
