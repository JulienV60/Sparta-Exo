# Playing with push

## Context and Objectives

When you want to put some elements in the end of your array, there is a method that works well: `push()`

Remember to look in [the array methods documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#instance_methods) if you need help or more information.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `10_play_with_push` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

### Use some methods

For this exercice, you can use those methods: **[push( )](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)** and **[length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length)**.

- Rewrite your array `digits` using one `push()` call per number;
- Rewrite your constant `last` using `length`;
