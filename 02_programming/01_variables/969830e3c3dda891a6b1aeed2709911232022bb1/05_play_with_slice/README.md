# Playing with slice

## Context and Objectives

Sometimes, you'll need to take only one part of a string. And for that, slice can be a good solution. Let's play with this method.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `05_play_with_slice` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

Let's create different constants:

- a constant `hobbyQuestion` bound to a string: "spartan, what is your hobby?!" using the method `slice()` and the constant `question`.
- a constant `hobbyQuestionLength` bound to a number that is the length of `hobbyQuestion`.
