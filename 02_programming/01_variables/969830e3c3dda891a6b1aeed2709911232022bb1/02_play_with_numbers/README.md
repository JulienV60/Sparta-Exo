# Playing with numbers

## Context and Objectives

Let's continue with variables, but now you'll use some numbers

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `src` file in the folder `02_play_with_numbers` and execute the exercice with `node ./index.js`

Let's create different constants:

- a constant called `foo`, binded to an integer: 12;
- a constant called `bar`, binded to an integer: 28;
- a constant called `sumResult`, binded to the sum of `foo` and `bar`;
- a constant called `prodResult`, binded to the product of `bar` and `foo`.
