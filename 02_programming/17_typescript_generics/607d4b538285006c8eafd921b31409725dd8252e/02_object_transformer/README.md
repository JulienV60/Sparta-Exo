# Object transformer

## Context and objectives

This time, you are working on you're company's products data and want to re arrange it.

## Overview

Let's make a `Product` type, that has:

- `productName` that is a `string`
- `quantity` that is a `number`

Then, let's make a `productTransformer` that takes an object as a parameter (that uses the type you just created) and returns an array filled with arrays of `receivedObject`'s key value pairs.
