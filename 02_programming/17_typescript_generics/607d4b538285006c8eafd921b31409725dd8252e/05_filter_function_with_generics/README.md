# Filter Function with Generics

## Context and objectives

Remember our old friend [`Array.prototype.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)?
We made a `filterFor` function that does kind of the same thing but with a `for..of`, however, we need to type it so that it works with any array.

## Specs

Without changing the body of the function, you should type the function so that it can accept any type of array.
