# The hero factory

## Context and objectives

You're an entrepreneur that just discovered a product that creates super powers. Because you're a megalomaniac (like every super vilain ðŸ˜Ž), you want to industrialise it.

## Overview

Let's make a `Hero` class (and dominate the world):

- It has a `name` attribute, because every hero has a name. It should be initialized in the `constructor`.
- It has a method called `sayHi`, that returns a string `I'm <name>!`.

And then, create a new instance of `Hero` that is called `batman` and has a name of `Batman`.
