# Testing Tree Class

## Context and Objectives

Until now we tested only small functions. Now we want to start testing bigger programs.

## Specs

We have the class `Tree`, a simplified version of an Orange Tree.

We want you to test the program to make sure it follows the tree rules.

## Hint

> It does follow the rules, no need to update the implementation file ;)
