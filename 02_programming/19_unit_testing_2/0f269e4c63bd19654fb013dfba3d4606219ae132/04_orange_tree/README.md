# Testing Orange Tree

## Context and Objectives

Now that we have tested the `Tree` class, let's test an implementation of it: `OrangeTree` that grows, die and grow oranges.

## Specs

The requirment for this exercise is to have a proper `Tree` test, to test `OrangeTree` to make sure it follows the orange tree rules.

## Hint

> Like your previous exercise, it does follow the rules, no need to update the implementation file ðŸ˜‰
