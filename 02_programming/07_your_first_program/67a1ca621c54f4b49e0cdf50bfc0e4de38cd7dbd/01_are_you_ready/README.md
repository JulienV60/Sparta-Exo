# Are you readyyyy

## Context and objectives

What could be best to start the day than a function that asks the users if they are ready ? Maybe two functions, but for now, you'll do one. ðŸ˜Ž

## Specs

Using `readline`, write a program in `src/readyForm.js`.

The `readyForm` function must ask the users if they are ready and print a motivating message before closing the stream. The message needs to repeat what the users said.

ex:
```shell
Hello user!
Are you ready for today ??!
> FREAKIN READY
WOW, FREAKIN READY ??!! Really Nice! Let's goo !!.
```

Use the command `yarn start` to launch your code!
