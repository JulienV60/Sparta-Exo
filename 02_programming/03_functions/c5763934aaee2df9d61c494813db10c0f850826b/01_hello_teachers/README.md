# Hello teachers!

## Context and objectives

For the first exercise of the day, you want to say hello to the teachers (with one `console.log()` per teacher).

It's like a "Hello World!" function but way fancier. ðŸ˜Ž

## Specs

In the `src/index.js`, write a function `sayHelloToTeachers ` that takes **an array** of teacher's names as _an argument_, and prints for each "Hello <teacherName>!"

E.g.

```javascript

sayHelloToTeachers(teachers)
/*
Hello Thomas!
Hello Fenn!
...
*/

```

You can see what your function does by running

```shell
yarn start
```

and run the tests with

```shell
yarn test
```
