# Filtering the letter `e`

## Context and objectives

Ernest Wright wrote [Gadsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel)) without using the letter `e` once in the novel, even though that's the most common letter in English.

To do that, it would have been useful to check that he didn't forget one line.

## Specs

In the `src/index.js`, write a function `theEFilter` that takes an array of sentences and only returns those that contain the letter `e`.

It should also return sentences that contain the uppercase `E`.
