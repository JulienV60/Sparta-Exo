# Always working greeter

## Context and objectives

For the first exercise of the day, you want to say hello to people but this time, there can be any number of them.
Iterators will help you achieve this.

## Specs

In the `src/index.js`, write a function `greeter` that takes an array of names as an argument, and prints for each "Hello <name>!"

E.g.

```javascript

greeter(teachers)
/*
Hello Clément!
Hello Nicolas!
...
*/

```

You can see what your function does by running

```bash
yarn start
```

and run the tests with

```bash
yarn test
```
