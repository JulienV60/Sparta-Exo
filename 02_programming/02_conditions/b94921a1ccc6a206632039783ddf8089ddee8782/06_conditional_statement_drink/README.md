# The conditional drinking

## Context and Objectives

In this exercise, the goal is to know conditions and objects better.
You will have to use the boolean algebra we talked about in the course.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, you can use `console.log()` with your variables and then, in your terminal, go to the folder `06_conditional_statement_drink` and execute the exercice with `node src/index.js`

### Can I Drink alcohol?

> Frieda and Francis walk on the street. Frieda is 22 and Francis is 17.

- Create two objects, `francis` and `frieda`, each with the fields : `age` (an integer) and `name` (obviously a string)
- Create two variables `canFriedaDrinkAlcohol` and `canFrancisDrinkAlcohol` to answer, respectively, to the question "Can he / she drink alcohol.". These variables should stay correct if we modify the ages of the objects `francis` and `frieda`.
