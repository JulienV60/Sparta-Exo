# Odin's Steward

## Context and Objectives

You are Odin's new steward in Asgard and he asked you to find Thor's hammer (you know, that one: ‚ö°Ô∏èüî®‚ö°Ô∏è) in the armoury.

## Specs

Code a constant `armouryWithNamesOnly` bound to an array called that has all the values of the object `armoury` using the object method to get all values (`google` is your friend)

Then, create a constant `isTheRequestInArmoury` bound to the check of the presence of `odinRequest` in `armouryWithNamesOnly`

Finally, create a condition that logs `"Ah, I finally found something to hammer that nail into"` if the `isTheRequestInArmoury` is true and `"What do you want me to do with this?"` if not
