# Coffee Recipes with object

## Context and Objectives

Let's modify our code from the previous exercise to make it an object! The tests are there to guide you on what should be present... but it's from "that guy" again who doesn't take the time to write descriptions to be helpful with the person who has to take the code back.

## Specs

We provided you with some new tests and the same data about coffee recipes and now you have to code the object `recipeMaker` as tests intended it to be. Good luck ðŸ’ª
## Validation

You should aim for complete validation of tests.

> You should reuse what you have done on the previous exercise!
