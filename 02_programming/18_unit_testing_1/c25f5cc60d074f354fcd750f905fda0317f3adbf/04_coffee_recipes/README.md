# Coffee Recipes

## Context and Objectives

Test Driven Development is a software development process that is based on creating tests before writing the actual code. This makes it possible to know the conditions that the code must meet to be considered "valid" for a given need.

## Specs

A fellow developer has provided you with some tests and some data about coffee recipes and your job here is to code the function `giveRecipe()` as tests intended it to be.
The problem here is that your colleague didn't take the time to write tests descriptions. You have to take your time to make a checklist of what is tested: it surely will be in your code!

## Validation

You should aim for complete validation of tests.

> You can add test descriptions to make it easier for you. ğŸ˜‰
