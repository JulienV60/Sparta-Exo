# Regex Phones (bonus)

## Context and objectives

For this bonus, first read the extra course on [Regular Expressions](/today/camp2/09_extras/16_regular_expressions).

When handling user inputs it is important to verify if what we get is ok with what we want.

## Specs

Implement a checkPhoneNumber function in `src/checkPhoneNumber.js`.

This function should take a french `phoneNumber` as a parameter and must return `true` if it matches your regex, `false` otherwise.

## Tests

As always, feel free to `yarn test` when you want.
